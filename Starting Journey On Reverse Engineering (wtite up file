This write-up documents my progress through the first introductory picoCTF challenges, focusing specifically on First Grep and First Find. These challenges are designed to introduce basic Linux command-line skills that are essential for solving Capture The Flag (CTF) problems. Through completing these tasks, I developed foundational knowledge in file handling, searching, and navigation within a Linux environment.

Challenge 1: First Grep

Objective:
The goal of the First Grep challenge was to locate the flag hidden inside a text file using the grep command.

Approach:
I was provided with a text file containing a large amount of data. Instead of manually scanning the file, I used the grep command to search for a specific keyword associated with the flag format (picoCTF{}).

Command Used:

grep picoCTF file.txt


Outcome:
The command successfully displayed the line containing the flag. This challenge helped me understand how powerful grep is for efficiently searching through files, especially when dealing with large datasets.

Key Takeaways:

Learned how to use grep to search for patterns in files

Understood the importance of command-line tools in speeding up problem solving

Recognized that flags often follow predictable formats that can be searched programmatically

Challenge 2: First Find

Objective:
The First Find challenge required locating a hidden file within a directory structure using the find command.

Approach:
The challenge directory contained many files and folders. I used the find command to search for files with specific characteristics, such as file name or type, instead of browsing manually.

Command Used:

find . -name 


After identifying the correct file, I opened it to retrieve the flag.

Outcome:
The correct file was located successfully, and the flag was extracted. This challenge demonstrated how find can be used to navigate complex directory structures efficiently.
