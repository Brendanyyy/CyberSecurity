Day 7: Implement all math concepts in Python (or C if preferred)

Weekend: Solve 5 beginner crypto challenges (picoCTF / CryptoHack)

Week 2: Classical + Symmetric Cryptography

Days 1–2: Classical ciphers (Caesar, Vigenère, Substitution, frequency analysis)

Days 3–4: Block ciphers fundamentals (DES concept, AES structure)

Day 5: Block cipher modes (ECB vs CBC vs CTR vs GCM)

Day 6: Padding (PKCS#7) + why ECB is insecure

Day 7: Implement AES encryption/decryption using Python library

Weekend: CryptoPals Set 1 (complete all challenges)

Week 3: Asymmetric Cryptography & Hashing

Days 1–2: RSA (math + full implementation from scratch)

Day 3: Diffie-Hellman key exchange

Day 4: Elliptic Curve Cryptography (concept + why it’s efficient)

Day 5: Hash functions (SHA-256, collisions, preimage resistance)

Day 6: Digital signatures + HMAC

Day 7: Use OpenSSL to generate keys, sign, verify

Weekend: Solve 10 crypto CTF challenges (medium level)

Week 4: Applied Cryptography & Real-World Security

Days 1–2: How HTTPS/TLS handshake works

Day 3: Password hashing (bcrypt, salting, PBKDF2)

Day 4: Random number generation + why weak RNG breaks crypto

Day 5: Common crypto attacks (padding oracle, replay, MITM)

Day 6: Analyze real vulnerabilities (ECB misuse, weak RSA keys)

Day 7: Try to solve a Advance Level Crypto Challenge 

Weekend: Join live CTF and attempt only crypto challenges
